Before running the preprocessing:
- Create folder "data" and move your training set, training label and training test there.
- Go to the file `preprocessing.py`. If it's the first time running the scipt, be sure to call the function "partition_trainin_set" with no parameters. If it's not the first time, please skip the first function call and execute the rest of the lines.
- Check out the function list, there are bunch of function either for loading data, showing images or playing around with.

After each run, there will be six ".npy" files appearing in your "/data" folder, 3 testing data files and 3 training data files. You will need them for the training stage.
